Easily display WordPress posts using the [display-posts] shortcode

== Description ==

The *Display Posts Shortcode* was written to allow users to easily display listings of posts without knowing PHP or editing template files.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `display-posts-shortcode` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
1. Add the shortcode to a post or page.
